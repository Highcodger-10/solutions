<h1> Simple Repository for DSA and NM</h1><br>
<p> It is a simple repository where I push my codes implementing various data structures in "Data Structures and Algorithms" directory and also the algorithms</p></p>
for different mathematical techniques in "Numerical Methods" directory. The repository is ready for further updates and anyone wanting to improve the code is welcomed</p>
<p> to do so. The codes are written in C++</p>
