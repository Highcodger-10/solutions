<h1> Simple Repository for DSA and NM</h1><br>
<p> It is a simple repository where I push my codes implementing various data structures in "Data Structures and Algorithms" directory and also the algorithms
for different mathematical techniques in "Numerical Methods" directory. The repository is ready for further updates and anyone wanting to improve the code is welcomed
to do so. The codes are written in C++</p>
